# GRC Risk Assessment Toolkit

## Overview
This project demonstrates asset-based risk assessment practices commonly used in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) roles. It focuses on identifying assets, evaluating associated risks, and documenting mitigation strategies.

## Components
The toolkit includes:
- An asset inventory identifying key assets and their sensitivity
- A risk register assessing threats, likelihood, impact, and priority
- Documentation of existing controls and recommended mitigations

## Methodology
Risks were assessed using a likelihood and severity scoring approach to determine priority. Controls were categorized to support consistent risk treatment and governance decisions.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Asset identification and classification  
- Risk analysis and prioritization  
- Control evaluation and mitigation planning  
- GRC documentation practices
